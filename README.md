# Biometric Classifier with Machine Learning
A machine learning project that classifies user identities from synthetic biometric feature datasets.

## Overview
This project trains a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model to classify users based on numerical biometric patterns.  
It simulates how AI can recognize individuals using distinctive patterns in their biometric data.

## Features
- Synthetic dataset generation  
- Machine learning training and testing  
- Accuracy evaluation  
- Modular and extensible design  

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **scikit-learn**

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

## Usage
- Run main.py.
- The script generates a dataset, trains a KNN model, and evaluates its accuracy.
- The final accuracy is displayed in the console.
